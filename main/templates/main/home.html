							I am a Computer Engineering student seeking internship opportunities in the tech space. I have a passion for technology and wish to make a career. Over the course of my studies, I have been challenged to become a better leader and learner. As a result, I have received awards that reflect my professionalism, hard work, and leadership skills. In addition, I have gained experience in the public and private tech sectors as an intern. Still, I wish to gain more in the tech industry, learning more about IT, Product Management, and Software Engineering, and have career assumptions to become a tech executive in the Midwest.
